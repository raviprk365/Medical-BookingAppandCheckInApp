Business Requirements Document (BRD)
Booking and Check-In App for a Single Australian Medical Practice
1. Executive Summary
This Business Requirements Document (BRD) outlines the requirements for a Booking and Check-In app tailored for a single medical practice in Australia. The app aims to streamline appointment scheduling and check-in processes, improve patient and staff experience, and ensure seamless integration with external booking platforms such as HotDoc or similar. Additionally, the app will support voice-based booking using platforms like ACS or Twilio. All requirements are designed to ensure compliance with Australian healthcare regulations, focusing on security, privacy, and usability.
2. Business Context
The medical practice operates as a single-site healthcare provider serving local patients. Currently, appointment scheduling and check-in are handled through manual processes and disparate digital systems, leading to inefficiencies, booking errors, and increased administrative workload. The practice seeks to:
•	Reduce administrative overhead
•	Minimize appointment errors and double bookings
•	Enhance patient experience and accessibility
•	Ensure secure and compliant handling of patient data
3. Stakeholder Analysis
Stakeholder	Role	Needs
Practice Manager	Operational oversight	Efficient workflow, reporting, compliance, staff management
Medical Practitioners	Service delivery	Accurate schedules, patient information, minimal disruptions
Reception Staff	Front-desk operations	Easy-to-use booking/check-in, reduced manual entry, error reduction
Patients	Service recipients	Accessible booking, privacy, timely notifications, voice options
IT Support	System maintenance	Integration support, system reliability, data security
4. Functional Requirements
•	Appointment Booking:
•	Patients can book, reschedule, or cancel appointments via web, mobile app, or voice (ACS/Twilio).
•	Integration with external booking systems (e.g., HotDoc) for real-time availability and synchronization.
